# DemoUnitsSystem
It's a demo project of characters' architecture. Characters can moving, fighting and playing some animation

For example, two charaters ('Ally' and 'Guardian') was created.

'Ally' is a melee character chasing the nearest character-target and then attack it and so on until death

'Guardian' is a stationary range character attacking character-targets in range
