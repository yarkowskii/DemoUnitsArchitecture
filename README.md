# DemoUnitsArchitecture
It's a small project where the characters system implemented. Characters have base possibilities such as move, fight, play animations, and it can be easily extended

For example, two charaters ('Ally' and 'Guardian') was created.

'Ally' is a melee character chasing the nearest character-target and then attack it and so on until death

'Guardian' is a stationary range character attacking character-targets in range
